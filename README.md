## Project Overview
This project analyzes user activity and sleep data from Fitbit devices to identify trends and provide insights that help Bellabeat improve its product strategy. The analysis was conducted using Power BI, Excel, and R, and follows the Google Data Analytics Capstone process.

## Business Task
To identify patterns in physical activity, sleep behavior, and wellness that Bellabeat can leverage to enhance its products and marketing strategy.

 ## Tools Used 🛠
- Power BI (dashboard design, data modeling, preprocessing, transformation)   
- R (correlation analysis & visualization)

## Data Source
- Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data (Public domain dataset from Kaggle)  
- Collected from 30 users between March and May 2016  
- Includes daily, hourly, and minute-level data on activity, sleep, and calories

## Additional Analysis using R
As part of the Bellabeat case study, statistical relationship analysis was conducted using R to complement the Power BI dashboard. Using ggplot2 and correlation methods, visualizations were created to explore the relationships between variables such as total steps, sleep efficiency, calories burned, and minutes asleep.

The R analysis is available in the file  relationship_analysis_R.Rmd , which includes full code, visual outputs, and interpretations. This addition enhanced the depth of insights by confirming trends and quantifying relationships using correlation coefficients.

## Summary of Key Findings
- Users with higher steps tend to burn more calories  
- Sleep efficiency is weakly related to activity  
- Most users are overweight and sleep fewer hours  
- Moderate activity had the strongest correlation with calorie burn  
- Activity peaked in April and May 
##  Product Recommendation
###  Recommended Product: Leaf
- Tracks sleep, activity, breathing, and stress
- Stylish and functional — ideal for Bellabeat’s female audience
- Best positioned to support users’ needs based on the data
##  Recommendations
1.	Promote Moderate Activity
Encourage users to engage in regular, moderate-intensity movements such as brisk walking, which showed the strongest correlation with calorie burn.
2.	Encourage Daily Movement
Users spent most of their time in sedentary behavior. Implement motivational features (e.g., reminders, step goals) to reduce inactivity and increase overall energy expenditure.
3.	Target Overweight Users with Personalized Plans
With over 50% of users in the overweight category, tailored wellness programs—covering nutrition, activity, and sleep—can have a meaningful impact.
4.	Improve Sleep Duration and Consistency
Many users sleep less than 6 hours on certain days. Adding features like bedtime reminders, sleep content, and progress tracking can help build healthy habits.
5.	Launch Data-Driven Seasonal Campaigns
Activity peaks during April and May. Use this seasonal behavior to time marketing campaigns, app challenges, or feature promotions for higher engagement.
